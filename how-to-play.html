            <h3>Pick Numbers</h3>
            
            <h4>First Set of Numbers</h4>
            <p>You can pick 3 numbers from 0–9. For example, if you chose 5, 3, and 6, they would be your first pick at random. To add more substance to the game, the numbers are then added up (5 + 3 + 6), and a final number is given, which is the total of the sum of all 3, i.e., 14. You will use only one digit of the selected numbers (14), so you will select the last one, which in this case is 4. So your first draw would be <strong>5, 3, and 6 x4</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Second Set of Numbers</h4>
            <p>A second set of numbers can also be drawn by a player. These numbers are drawn in exactly the same way as the first draw. As a random example, let's assume the numbers 8, 2, and 8. This gives us a total of 18, from which the player will again use only the last digit, so our final pick for the second set of numbers is <strong>8, 2, 8 x 8</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Final Card</h4>
            <p>The final card would look like - <strong>(5, 3, 6 x 4) X (8, 2, 8 x 8)</strong>.</p>
